## Project Summary

Boomtown is a web application designed for users to partake in a sharing economy by listing items online and borrowing items from other users.

01/22/2017: Boomtown has the following functionality in place:
-> Users can filter items by tags and view items in a masonary-style layout (resembling Instagram and Pinterest). Users can see whether items are borrowed or available.
-> Users can click on other users to see all the items owned by that user and whether the items are available or not.
-> Users can view their own profile page using the 'Profile' button.
-> The logout button routes to the login page, but no actual login logic is in place.
-> The share button exists and leads to a stub page.

NOTE: for testing purposes, the logged-in user is: "eEvh1WUF5nb5eeUksUQb3Ph0kOU2" (Mandi Wise).
